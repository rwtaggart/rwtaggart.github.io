Richard is a senior manager of the IBM Z pre-silicon microprocessor verification team. He pursued a career as a software engineer for nearly a decade before taking on a management role in 2021. He currently resides and works in the Hudson Valley of New York.

Richard pursued many interests throughout his career by taking on various roles as a software developer, architect, designer, web developer, and data scientist. Throughout that time, his focus has been on process and tool automation for IBM high-performance microprocessors in electronic design automation (EDA). He has presented this work on behalf of his teams at the Design Automation Conference and PyCon US conferences. He is a coinventor of three filed US patents contributing to the domain of EDA.

Richard has acquired a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, a master’s degree in computer science from Pace University, and an AI: deep learning specialization professional certificate from Coursera. He consistently works on his communication, coaching, mentoring, and people development skills. Richard considers programming and data science as his primary interests of study, and he continues to search for ways he can integrate these fields with the automation of mundane routine habitual activities in his daily life.

Richard was recently married to his wife Marissa in June 2022. In his personal time, Richard has several hobbies including skiing and music. He tries to spend as much time outdoors as possible and enjoys soccer, golf, and tennis, as well.

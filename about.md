I am a senior manager of the IBM Z pre-silicon microprocessor design verification team. I've spent more than a decade leading computer engineering teams. I currently reside and work in the Hudson Valley of New York. I contribute to our local technical community, and I'm a senior member of the IEEE Computer Society.

My personal mission is to make technology more accessible and improve the quality of life for everyone. I am passionate about improving the way we work, and I tend to seek creative ways to help teams unleash their full potential. 
I pursued this through multiple experiences in the fields of computer engineering and computer science.
Over the past decade, I focused on workflow automation for the design of IBM Z high-performance microprocessors; this is known as Electronic Design Automation (EDA). I presented this work on behalf of my team at the Design Automation Conference and PyCon US conference. I co-invented three filed US patents contributing to the domain of EDA.

I acquired a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, a master’s degree in computer science from Pace University, and an AI: deep learning specialization professional certificate from Coursera. Over the past four years, I created a self-directed curriculum to learn the art of effective management. However, I still consider programming and data science my primary interests of study, and I continue to search for ways I can integrate these fields with the automation of mundane routine habitual activities in my daily life.

In my personal time, I have several hobbies including skiing and music. I try to spend as much time outdoors as possible and enjoy soccer, golf, and tennis.

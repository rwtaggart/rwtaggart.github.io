I am a senior member of technical staff for the AMD silicon design verification team. My personal mission is to make technology more accessible and improve the quality of life for everyone. I'm passionate about improving the way we work, and I seek creative ways to help people realize their full potential.
I spent the past decade leading computer engineering teams in pursuit of this mission in the field of microprocessor design and verification. I contribute to our local technical community of the Hudson Valley in New York as a senior member of the IEEE Computer Society.

I focused on workflow automation for the design of IBM Z high-performance microprocessors from 2012 to 2025; this is known as Electronic Design Automation (EDA). I presented this work on behalf of my team at the Design Automation Conference and PyCon US conference. I co-invented three filed US patents contributing to the domain of EDA.

I acquired a bachelor degree in electrical engineering from Clarkson University, a master degree in computer science from Pace University, and an AI: deep learning specialization professional certificate from Coursera. 
I also completed a four-year self-directed curriculum to learn the art of effective management. 
Still, programming and data science remain my primary interests of study, and I continue to search for ways I can combine these fields with the automation of mundane routine habitual activities in my daily life.

I reside in the Hudson Valley of New York with my wife Marissa and our son Theo. In my personal time, I have several hobbies including skiing and music. I try to spend as much time outdoors as possible and enjoy soccer, golf, and tennis.

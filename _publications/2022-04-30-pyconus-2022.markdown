### Leveraging a custom CPython data model for high-performance microprocessor design

#### Description
_"This talk will share our experience of incorporating modern free open-source software technologies into a complicated ecosystem of commercial toolchains and workflows for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). After this talk, I hope you will be inspired to experiment with integrating C or C++ and C Python bindings into your application workflow. I hope this may help you think about different ways you might be able to integrate various methods of data science into your application domain."_

Identify and convey the most important idea when you communicate with another person. This will allow you to elicit the greatest effect for your intent and effort. In today's world, we wish to spend our energy on more activities than we have time for; various distractions pull our attention in many facets of our life. Allow your recipient to interpret your message with as little energy as possible.

These are some tips to consider when composing a message:

1. Write down the topics, ideas, and thoughts you wish to send.
2. Identify the common theme between these thoughts.
3. Convey that "main idea" with one or two brief supporting examples.

When I asked my wife about the meaning of Christmas she responded, “I want to teach our son it’s about sharing the gift of unconditional love without any expectations in return.” In my experience, inspiration may come from anywhere which includes my younger brothers. My youngest brother is among the most generous people I know. He has been an exceptional gift giver for as long as I can remember. He possesses an incredible innate ability to craft a special experience of celebrating those of whom are close with him. From this frame, I derived three questions based on his approach to the holidays.

When considering a person for a future occasion, answer these questions:

1. What will the person be feeling in the moment?
2. What is the feeling I hope they remember?
3. How should I influence their experience?

Spending five minutes of crafting answers to these questions will help create a deeper connection to anyone. Sometimes the answers may lead to a physical gift, while others may yield a simple gesture. Keeping in mind what someone will feel, remember, and experience is where the magic of Christmas begins.

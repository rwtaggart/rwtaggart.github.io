When I asked my wife about the meaning of Christmas she responded, “I want to teach our son it’s about sharing the gift of unconditional love without any expectations in return.” This answer resonated with me so deeply because I’ve seen someone live by this virtue for as long as I can remember. My youngest brother is among the most generous people I know. He has been an exceptional gift giver for his entire life. He possesses an incredible innate ability to create special celebratory experiences for those who are close to him. From this frame, I derived three basic questions based on his approach to the holidays.

When considering a person for a future occasion, answer these questions:

1. What will the person be feeling in the moment?
2. What is the feeling I hope they remember?
3. How should I influence their experience?

Spending five minutes to craft answers for these questions will help create a deeper connection with anyone. Sometimes the answers may lead to a physical gift, while others may yield a simple gesture. Keeping in mind what someone will feel, remember, and experience is where the magic of Christmas begins.

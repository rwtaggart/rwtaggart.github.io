As we ring in the new year, I can’t help but notice the undercurrent of tender excitement floating in the air. We remember the fun of past celebrations with family and friends, as we replay the highlights from a whole year gone by. In the final days leading up to this moment, while wrapping up the end of a trip around the sun and awaiting the beginning of the next one, we can take a brief respite of recovery from the hectic magic lingering after the holiday season.

Now is the perfect time for personal reflection. It is a time for us to extend our time horizon, imagine what the future holds for us, and determine how to shape that vision into reality. It is a time for hope by setting a clear goal, determining the path to get there, and acquiring the agency to achieve it<sup>1</sup>.

When you’re ready, as yourself these questions:

1. **How do I define success?**  
    _What does it look like? How would it feel? How will I know if I achieve it?_
   
1. **What do I need to learn in order to get there?**  
   _What’s the next step I need to take?_
   
1. **What support do I need and from whom?**  
   _Who can help me accomplish my goals? What does support look like from them?_


Use three time scales for each response:

--: | ---
Near-term | 6-12 months
Medium-term | 2-3 years
Long-term | >5 years

Review your answers to these questions 2-3 times per year. Make adjustments as you learn and adapt. Ask yourself the following questions to validate, augment, or rethink your approach<sup>2</sup>:

1. When did I form the aspirations I’m currently pursuing?
2. How have I changed since then?
3. Have I reached a learning plateau, and is it time to consider a pivot?

Review your responses with a critical eye. Imagine yourself as the editor of your life’s narrative. If you find yourself stuck, hesitant, apprehensive, or overwhelmed, then shorten the time-scale and try again. This approach will help clarify your desires and identify your next step. 


#### Declare your mission
As a final step, capture your answers from the questions above, and write a personal mission statement.
This should be a concise, meaningful phrase that resonates with you at a deep, personal level.
Declaring a personal mission helps guide our decisions and ensure we make progress towards achieving our vision of success<sup>3</sup>.

Before departing for a 3-month sabbatical, a close friend of mine had to temporarily shed his responsibilities. 
He used a simple process for enumerating the various roles he assumed on our team.
The framework below provides a general form of his process for defining the roles and responsibilities that an individual 
carries for a team, aptly named the Reindel method.
This method captures how someone spends their time on a weekly basis.

It provides an implementation of the "one minute goal," 
proposed by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson in the [_One Minute Manager_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Minute_Manager).
Using this method, an individual should be able to read, understand, and internalize the defined goals in under a minute.
The process is simple, and it should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete.


## The Reindel Method

1. List the titles of any roles or projects you carry for your team.

2. Enumerate any recurring tasks, responsibilities, or special deliverables required for each role or project.

3. Assign an approximate percentage of time spent each week on each role or project.

4. Highlight any concerns or time conflicts which need to be addressed.

expectations of the role they fulfill.
This template provides a framework for how to enumerate these responsibilities.
An individual may have any number of roles, responsibilities, or recurring tasks.

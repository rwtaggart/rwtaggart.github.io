If humans have a superpower, it's this: we can learn anything from anyone. The trick is to figure out how.
I stumbled on an interview with Tom Hanks, and he gave three simple powerful pieces of advice.

1. **Show up on time**  
    <span class="sub">Which means, show up a little early.</span>

2. **Know the text**  
    <span class="sub">Know what's going on, understand the context, identify everyone's goals, and be present. </span>

3. **Have an idea**  
    <span class="sub">Make an original unique contribution that no one else has.</span>  
<br/>

The interview is available on YouTube, and I recommend watching it!
